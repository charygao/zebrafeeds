            <h2><a name="install">Installation</a></h2>
            <div class="text">
                <ul>
                    <li>Uncompress the package</li>
                    <li>Upload the newsfeeds directory to your web host</li>
                    <li><strong>Run the installation script</strong>.
                    Surf to <em>&lt;ZebraFeedsURL&gt;/install.php</em>.</li>

					<li>Possibly customize a template or make your own</li>
					<li>if you set "use subscription file" to "no" then
					configuration of feeds list will nolonger be available in the administration
					panel, therefore you must set them manually</li>
					<li>if you set "render mode" to "manual" then
					including <code>zebrafeeds.php</code> ZebraFeeds will NOT display
					anything. therefore you must use the manual functions.</li>
					<li>See the appropriate <a href="#include">documentation section</a>. Either
					<ul>
						<li>Open <code>demo.php</code> in your browser or look at it to include ZebraFeeds on
						your page (include <code>newsfeeds/zebrafeeds.php</code> ). </li>
						<li>look at <code>demo_manual.php</code> to have an example of manual
						configuration.
					</ul></li>
					<li>If you plan to use the "on request" feeds refresh mode, configure your cron-job
					or webpage checker service to according to the link provided
					after validating the config page.<br/>
					If you place your ZebraFeeds installation in an Apache password protected area,
					you might want to take a look at the sample htaccess file provided in the
					newsfeeds/pub directory.</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				ZebraFeeds implements two mechanisms for login to the administration panel.
				You can use:
				<ul>
					<li>server - HTTP Server Basic Auth (has limitations on several
					webservers such as the ones that run PHP as CGI; sends user password
					base64 encoded; when you logout you need to press cancel when
					the authentication box appears)</li>
					<li>session - PHP sessions (depends on your webhost's php.ini
					configuration and can use cookies; sends user password clear text)</li>
				</ul>

				The administration panel can be found at the url
				<pre>ZF_URL/admin/index.php</pre>
				Default user is <em>admin</em>, pass is <em>admin</em>.
				Change these settings as soon as possible.
			</div>

			<div class="text">
				<h3>PHP script integration</h3>
				This section describes the integration of ZebraFeeds script in another PHP script.<br/>
				Once the installation is succesfull you can include the feedsreader on
				your PHP page. You must include the main script in the
				&lt;body&gt; section and the header script in the &lt;head&gt; section.
				The header script handles thre template's CSS and javascript, while the
				main script renders the aggregated feeds.<br/><em>Note: if you don't plan
					to use a template with
					a templateHeader section (that is, no style sheet),
					the header script may not be necessary.</em><br/>
				<br/>
				Here is an example of a minimal page (must be put
				in the directory containing the 'newsfeeds' dir): <br/>

				<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;?php include('newsfeeds/zebraheader.php'); ?&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;?php include('newsfeeds/zebrafeeds.php'); ?&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

				<br/>

				<h5>ZebraFeeds cookie support</h5>
				If you want individual visitors to see new news items since they last visit,
				you need to include <code>zebracookies.php</code>.
				It must be done before any other output, since cookies are sent in the headers.

				<pre>
&lt;?php include ('newsfeeds/zebracookies.php'); ?&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
   &lt;?php include ('newsfeeds/zebraheader.php'); ?&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
   &lt;?php include ('newsfeeds/zebrafeeds.php'); ?&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
				See the below the section of the documentation pertaining to marking new items.

				<h5>ZebraFeeds control bar</h5>
				If you want to use the ZebraFeeds control bar, include<br/>

<pre>&lt;?php include ('newsfeeds/zebrabar.php'); ?&gt;</pre>

				somewhere in the BODY section.<br/>
				<br/>
				The ZebraFeeds control bar features useful controls to display/manage
				your feeds: <br/>
				<ul>
					<li>Displays all subscription lists configured in the admin
					panel</li>
					<li>Sort new by date or by channel</li>
					<li>Access to the admin panel</li>
				</ul>
				It should ideally be used if you plan to use ZebraFeeds as a personal
				feed reader, not if you just publish feeds on your site.<br/>
				<br/>
				The bar just makes easy the use of the
				URL parameters available when calling ZebraFeeds: <br/>
				<ul>
					<li>zftemplate - a template name (filename in templates
					directory, without the extension)</li>
					<li>zflist - subscription list name (filename in categories
					subdirectory, without the extension) </li>
					<li>zfviewmode - 'feed' or 'date' </li>
					<li>zftrim - composed value (ex '4days', '6hours' or '15news') or keyword: 'today', 'yesterday', 'onlynew' </li>
				</ul>

				examples:
				<br/>

				<code>http://example.com/newsfeeds/page_with_zebrafeeds.php?zftemplate=logos</code> - will
				show the feeds with the "logos" template<br/>
				<code>http://example.com/page_with_zebrafeeds.php?zftemplate=some&amp;zflist=linux</code>
				will show only the feeds from the linux subscription list (that you
				defined in ZebraFeeds subscription lists admin panel) <br/>
				Of course, these parameters are meant to be used in URLs, not in PHP include statements.
				(<em>Note: in this example, <code>page_with_zebrafeeds.php</code>
					refers to the PHP script including <code>zebrafeeds.php</code></em>) <br/>

				<h3>Manual configuration</h3>
				The other way of including ZebraFeeds is to use the manual mode. Instead of
				having ZebraFeeds automatically generate code in your page, you can call
				specialised functions that will allow more control on
				the way the aggregation HTML code is generated.<br/>
				Manual mode is disabled by default and can be enabled by the appropriate option
				of the configuration page.<br/>

				See the relevant section for more information on the manual mode functions.
				<em>Note: if you choose not to use OPML lists, the manual mode is the only way to
					display anything with ZebraFeeds.</em>

			<h3>Share your feeds!</h3>

			<div class="text">
				ZebraFeeds allows you to republish the feeds you carefully aggregated. There are
				two ways to do so: exportin through RSS or using javascript. Be aware that some
				copyright issues may arise in case you re-publish copyrighted content.
				<h4>Share using the RSS feed export</h4>
				You can share the news from a subscription list via an RSS 2.0 feed of the aggregation.<br/>
				The subscription list becomes a channel in itself, with a Feed URL, just like all the
				channels of your subscription list.

				The URL of the feed looks like
				<pre>ZF_URL?f=rss&amp;zflist=LIST</pre>
				Where ZF_URL is the value set in the configuration page, telling at what URL
				ZebraFeeds is installed.
				and LIST is the subscription list name (possibly URL encoded).<br/>
				This URL can be used to subscribe in any other online/offline news aggregator
				(including ZebraFeeds itself!)
				So that the readers of your web site can subscribe to your aggregated news.<br/>
				<br/>
				Look at <code>demo_rssfeed.php</code> to see how to customize your feeds.

				<h4>Share using the javascript export</h4>
				You can publish ZebraFeeds aggregations on any website using the Javascript export.<br/>
				Just include this line in the body of the page where you want to display your feeds
				<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="ZF_URL?f=js&amp;zflist=LIST&amp;zftemplate=TEMPLATE"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </pre>
				Where ZF_URL is the URL to the installed ZebraFeeds, LIST is the subscription
				list you want to include, and TEMPLATE the template to use for display.<br/>
				Please note that if the template contains a style sheet in the templateHeader section,
				then the feed won't be displayed properly.
				So make sure to use a template that doesn't require a style sheet. <br/>
				If the template references CSS classes from the embedding page, the feed will
				integrate more nicely into the page.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Take a look at <code>demo_js.html</code> for a concrete example.


			</div>
			<h3>Refresh feeds by cronjob</h3>
			<div class="text">
				See the configuration page of the Administration panel to set up "On request"
				feed refresh mode.<br/>
				After selecting this option and saving the config, you'll be provided with a
				link whose url must be fetched at regular intervals in order to refresh the newsfeeds<br/>
				<br/>
				Two aspects to take into account:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>When configured, the feeds are NOT updated upon page generation anymore</strong>.</li>
					<li><strong>The individual feed's refresh time still applies.</strong>
					<br/>
					If you configure a service to call the refresh link every 30 minutes, it means
					that the feeds will be checked for expiration that often.
					It doesn't mean that the feeds will be fetched from the publisher all the time. </li>
				</ul>

				<br/>
				This feature requires to setup an admin user and password, therefore, the link will change
				whenever the admin name or password changes.
			</div>

			<h3>Mark new items</h3>
			<div class="text">

				ZebraFeeds can optionally highlight news items which are more recent that the
				visitor's last visit.<br/>
				To achieve this, it must record the time of last visits of visitors. This can
				be done in 2 ways
				<ul>
					<li>on server: then it applies to all visitors indistinctly. It requires no
					additional change on your page since the time is stored in the data subdirectory.
					This option is more appropriate if you use
					ZebraFeeds as a personal aggregator.</li>
					<li>by cookie: each visitor has their own last visit time stored in a browser cookie, and will see items fetched
					since their last personal visit on the site.
					This option requires to include <code>zebracookies.php</code> on your page
					(see the relevant section of the manual)</li>
				</ul>
				To mark new items on the generated html content, you have to include
				the template tag {isnew} in your template (see below).
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2><a name="mmode">Manual mode</a></h2>

			<div class="text">
				By default, feeds are displayed where <code>zebrafeeds.php</code> is included. If you enable the manual mode, the feed
				rendering only happens where (and if) you make use of the ZebraFeeds public functions. <br/>
				Manual mode allows full control of
				<ul>
					<li>Feeds selection</li>
					<li>News filtering</li>
					<li>Rendering and presentation</li>
				</ul>
				<em>Note: if you choose not to use OPML lists, the manual mode is the only way to display anything with ZebraFeeds.</em>

				<h5>Feeds selection</h5>
				These functions configure what feeds to aggregate.
				<ul>
					<li>zf_addFeed: add a newsfeed to the aggregator. If you do not wish to use the OPML lists feature, you have to manually
					configure the feeds that ZebraFeeds aggregates.</li>
					<li>zf_useList: tells ZebraFeeds to use the subscription list you configured in the administration panel</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>News filtering</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>zf_trim: show only the last news/days/hours (will force group by date)</li>
					<li>zf_match: show only news containing a keyword or a character string, case not significant</li>
					<li>zf_setNewsFilterFunction: accept only news based on user-defined function. Can also be used to alter news content.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>Rendering and presentation</h5>
				By default, ZebraFeeds presents the news sorted by channel using the template defined in the admin panel, unless you call:
				<ul>
					<li>zf_groupByDate: display news sorted by date</li>
					<li>zf_reset: reset to restart a display loop with different parameters/feeds</li>
					<li>zf_useTemplate: changes the rendering template. Beware that if the template
					requires a style section to be inserted in the header, it will probably not work as expected.
					For this matter, use templates that don't need a "templateHeader" section to work.</li>
				</ul>
				Finally, call <pre>zf_renderView</pre> to render the aggregated newsfeeds. It must be called after all the others.<br/>
				If you want to generate another aggregation block on your page, call <pre>zf_reset</pre> to restart from scratch.
				See the <code>demo_manual.php</code> script for more details and examples. See <code>includes/controller.php</code> script
				for a detailed list of functions and their parameters.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h2><a name="templates">Template reference</a></h2>

			<div class="text">
				You can customize the look of the aggregated feeds by editing the
				templates or creating new ones.<br/>

				A template is a file that contains HTML/XHTML code with special tags, in sections to be
				interpreted by ZebraFeeds. Templates file names have must have the html
				extension to be recognised.<br/>
				Sections should contain tags so that the parser can format the actual data into them.
				<br/>
				<h4>Template sections</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>templateHeader: before any channel display. use it to include
					javascript, css... Is included in the HEAD section of the page.
					Parsed for the {dynamictemplate} tag</li>
					<li>header: header before channel header. It is not parsed for any tag.</li>
					<li>listHeader: prints the subscription list header. To show list name, description</li>
					<li>channel: prints the channel header. Use it to show channel logo,
					title...</li>
					<li>channelFooter: formats the channel footer. Not parsed</li>
					<li>listFooter: formats the list's footer. Not parsed</li>
					<li>news: formats a news item when sorted by channel. Parsed for tags.</li>
					<li>newsByDate: formats a news items when sorted by date. Parsed for tags.</li>
					<li>newsDay: printed at every new day when items are sorted by date. Use
					{date} tag to print the date (see below).</li>
					<li>newsdayFooter: formats the day footer. Not parsed</li>
					<li>article: Used when rendering a single newsitem in a full page. Parsed for tags</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>How sections are rendered</h4>
				When sorted by feed, the output is generated this way:
				<blockquote style="border-left: 1px dotted #333; padding-left: 4px" >
					<ul>
						<li><code>header</code></li>
						<li>For each feed
						<ul>
							<li><code>channel</code></li>
							<li>for each news item
							<ul>
								<li><code>news</code></li>
							</ul>
							</li>
							<li><code>channelFooter</code></li>
							<li><code>between</code></li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li><code>footer</code></li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				It's a bit different when sorted by date. It's like having only one channel to display, but news are broken down by day: <br/>
				<br/>
				<blockquote style="border-left: 1px dotted #333; padding-left: 4px;">
					<ul>
						<li><code>header</code></li>
						<li><code>listHeader</code> (with list name taken as channel name)</li>
						<li>For each day
						<ul>
							<li><code>newsDay</code>
							<li>For each news item
							<ul>
								<li><code>newsByDate</code> (or <code>news</code> if empty)</li>
							</ul></li>
							<li><code>newsDayFooter</code></li>
						</ul></li>
						<li><code>listFooter</code></li>
						<li><code>footer</code></li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>
				The following tags are supported in the sections. Due to the linear way of processing
				templates, some tags will be relevant in certain contexts depending on
				the section they are included in:<br/>

				<h4>The article section</h4>
				The article section will be used to print the full news items in the article view.<br/>
				The article view embeds the news item at the location where zebrafeeds.php is included on your page.
				(It shows one article where it would show the list of news and channels). This is meant to display the news
				content once clicked on the title, nicely integrated in your page.<br/>
				The link to view a news item in the Article view can be embedded in the news list thanks to the {articleurl} template tag.

				<h4>Channel tags</h4>
				<ul>

					<li>{chanlogo} is replaced with the channel's logo if available</li>
					<li>{chanlogourl} is replaced with the address of the channel's logo if available</li>
					<li>{chanlink} is replaced with URL to the channel</li>
					<li>{chandesc} is replaced with the channel description</li>
					<li>{chantitle} is replaced with the channel title</li>
					<li>{chanid} is replaced with an unique ID of the channel
					(feed) being displayed (useful if you want to play with Javascript) </li>
					<li>{lastupdated} is replaced with the time/date when the feed was last fetched,
					according to date format</li>
					<li>{feedurl} is replaced with the RSS feed url</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>News item and article tags</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>{title} is replaced with the news title</li>
					<li>{link} is replaced with the URL to the news page</li>
					<li>{link_encoded} is replaced with the URL to the news page, encoded to be used as parameter in an hypertext link</li>
					<li>{pubdate} is replaced with the news publication date if
					available, formatted according to configuration</li>
					<li>{relativedate} relative news item date "1h ago", "3d ago"...</li>
					<li>{description} is replaced with the available news
					description (full-length content as provided by the source). If the template is dynamic, the news content is
					hidden depending on its length, will be retrieved dynamically by the
					browser. The description is always included in a div of the CSS class <em>zfnewscontent</em></li>
					<li>{summary} the news summary as truncated by ZebraFeeds</li>
					<li>{enclosures} the list of external enclosures of the news, if any. Autodetection of audio and video content, with relevant icons.</li>
					<li>{itemid} unique news item ID (useful if you want to play with Javascript) </li>
					<li>{isnew} string to insert if the news hasn't been seen before (string must be changed manually in <code>init.php</code>, variable ZF_ISNEWSTRING), empty otherwise (if configured in admin panel)</li>
					<li>{zfitemurl} URL pointing to the of the news description to be rendered by ZebraFeeds (not link to news source). Useful for personal aggregators. dynamicDescription template section must be defined for it to be of any use</li>
					<li>{readfullnewslink} link to the full-length news, rendered within ZebraFeeds (not link to news source). Useful when summary is used in template</li>
					<li>{articleurl} link to show the entire news item in a the article view, a page formatted with the article template section</li>

				</ul>
				<h4>News day tags</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>{date} is replaced with the date of the news items displayed beneath.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4> Special tags</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>{dynamictemplate}: in templateHeader or header section only. Includes the
					necessary code to handle AJAX dynamic browsing. ZebraFeeds will detect
					this tag and adapt the rendering accordingly</li>
					<li>{morebutton} is replaced with a button which displays all of the stored
					<li>{refreshbutton} is replaced with a button which forces the
					refresh of the feeds from the source, and displays the refreshed news
					for that feed.
					Requires {dynamictemplate} to be set in the templateHeader</li>
					<li>{hidebutton} is replaced with a button to hide the channel (works with
					javascript)</li>
					<li>{foldbutton} is replaced with a button to fold the channel news (works with
					javascript)</li>
					<li>{scripturl} is replaced with the url to your script</li>
					<li>{list} is replaced with the name of the current subscription list, if applicable</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Built-in styles</h4>
				ZebraFeeds generates some output that have forced CSS attributes.
				Proper styling using CSS helps a seamless integration on your site.<br/>
				This sections lists all CSS elements that you can add to your style sheet
				<ul>
					<li><em>zfnewscontent</em> CSS class: styles all news text (description).</li>
					<li><em>zfchannelstatus</em> CSS class: styles the channel messages, like errors and AJAX notifications are styled using this class.</li>
					<li><em>zfnewsbox</em> CSS class: styles the list of all news of a particular channel.</li>
					<li><em>zfchannelbox</em> CSS class: styles everything of a particular channel (in channel view mode), including channel header and list of all news.</li>
					<li><em>generator</em> CSS ID: the credit line that is added after the feeds rendering carries this ID.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Special feature : dynamic browsing</h4>
				To take advantage of AJAX to dynamically fetch news from your site as
				you want to read them, and not get all of them sent every time you load
				the page, you can use this kind of code in the "news" section of the
				template. <br/>
<pre> &lt;span onClick="showItem('{feedurl}','{itemid}');"&gt;{title}&lt;/span&gt;</pre>
				See the <code>infojunkie</code>,<code>twopane</code> and <code>newsflow</code>,	 templates for details and examples.<br/>
